    "# Unit Testing\n",
    "Equally important as writing good code is writing good tests. Better to find bugs yourself than have them reported to you by end users!\n",
    "\n",
    "For this section we'll be working with files outside the notebook. We'll save our code to a .py file, and then save our test script to another .py file. Normally we would code these files using a text editor like Brackets or Atom, or inside an IDE like Spyder or Pycharm. But, since we're here, let's use Jupyter!\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that with some IPython magic we can write the contents of a cell to a file using %%writefile.\n",
    "Something we haven't seen yet; you can run terminal commands from a jupyter cell using !\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing tools\n",
    "There are dozens of good testing libraries out there. Most are third-party packages that require an install, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - pylint\n",
    "    - pyflakes\n",
    "    - pep8\n",
    "These are simple tools that merely look at your code, and they'll tell you if there are style issues or simple problems like variable names being called before assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "A far better way to test your code is to write tests that send sample data to your program, and compare what's returned to a desired outcome.\n",
    "Two such tools are available from the standard library:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - unittest\n",
    "    - doctest\n",
    "Let's look at pylint first, then we'll do some heavier lifting with unittest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## pylint\n",
    "pylint tests for style as well as some very basic program logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, if you don't have it already (and you probably do, as it's part of the Anaconda distribution), you should install pylint.\n",
    "Once that's done feel free to comment out the cell, you won't need it anymore."
