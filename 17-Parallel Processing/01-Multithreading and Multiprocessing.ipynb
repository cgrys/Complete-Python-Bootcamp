    "# Multithreading and Multiprocessing\n",
    "Recall the phrase \"many hands make light work\". This is as true in programming as anywhere else.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you could engineer your Python program to do four things at once? What would normally take an hour could (almost) take one fourth the time.\\*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the idea behind parallel processing, or the ability to set up and run multiple tasks concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\* *We say almost, because you do have to take time setting up four processors, and it may take time to pass information between them.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Threading vs. Processing\n",
    "A good illustration of threading vs. processing would be to download an image file and turn it into a thumbnail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part, communicating with an outside source to download a file, involves a thread. Once the file is obtained, the work of converting it involves a process. Essentially, two factors determine how long this will take; the input/output speed of the network communication, or I/O, and the available processor, or CPU.\n",

    "## Multithreading Example: Webscraping\n",
    "Historically, the programming knowledge required to set up multithreading was beyond the scope of this course, as it involved a good understanding of Python's Global Interpreter Lock (the GIL prevents multiple threads from running the same Python code at once). Also, you had to set up special classes that behave like Producers to divvy up the work, Consumers (aka \"workers\") to perform the work, and a Queue to hold tasks and provide communcations. And that was just the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we've already learned one of the most valuable tools we'll need â€“ the map() function. When we apply it using two standard libraries, multiprocessing and multiprocessing.dummy, setting up parallel processes and threads becomes fairly straightforward.\n",
